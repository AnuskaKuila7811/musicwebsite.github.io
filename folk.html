    <h1>FOLK</h1>
    <p class="p">
        Folk music is a music genre that includes traditional folk music and the contemporary genre that evolved from
        the former during the 20th-century folk revival. Some types of folk music may be called world music. Traditional
        folk music has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, music
        that is played on traditional instruments, music about cultural or national identity, music that changes between
        generations (folk process), music associated with a people's folklore, or music performed by custom over a long
        period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. The term originated in the 19th
        century, but folk music extends beyond that. <br><br>

        Starting in the mid-20th century, a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music. This
        process and period is called the (second) folk revival and reached a zenith in the 1960s. This form of music is
        sometimes called contemporary folk music or folk revival music to distinguish it from earlier folk forms.[1]
        Smaller, similar revivals have occurred elsewhere in the world at other times, but the term folk music has
        typically not been applied to the new music created during those revivals.

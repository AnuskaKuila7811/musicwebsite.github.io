        <h1>JAZZ</h1>
        <p class="p">jazz, musical form, often improvisational, developed by African Americans and influenced by both
            European harmonic structure and African rhythms. It was developed partially from ragtime and blues and is often
            characterized by syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, often
            deliberate deviations of pitch, and the use of original timbres. <br><br>
    
            Any attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile. Jazz has been, from
            its very beginnings at the turn of the 20th century, a constantly evolving, expanding, changing music, passing
            through several distinctive phases of development; a definition that might apply to one phase—for instance, to
            New Orleans style or swing—becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history, say, to free
            jazz.

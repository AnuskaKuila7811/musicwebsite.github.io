  <p class="p">Classical music generally refers to the art music of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk
    music or popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the term "classical
    music" also applies to non-Western art music. Classical music is often characterized by formality and complexity in
    its musical form and harmonic organization, particularly with the use of polyphony. Since at least the ninth
    century it has been primarily a written tradition, spawning a sophisticated notational system, as well as
    accompanying literature in analytical, critical, historiographical, musicological and philosophical practices. A
    foundational component of Western Culture, classical music is frequently seen from the perspective of individual or
    groups of composers, whose compositions, personalities and beliefs have fundamentally shaped its history.
